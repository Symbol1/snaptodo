This is snaptodo package,
an alternative to todonote package,
from which it differs in the following ways:

* Depending on where you call `\snaptodo`,
  the note is put on the left or right margin,
  whichever is closer.
* The notes bump each other down so they never overlap;
  the lines never overlap either.
* Minimalistic, aesthetic and customizable style.
