This is snaptodo,
an alternative to todonote 
that differs in the following ways

* Depending on where you call `\todo`,
  the note is on the left or right margin,
  whichever is closer.
* The notes bump each other
  so they never overlap;
  the lines never overlap either
* Aesthetic and customizable style.
